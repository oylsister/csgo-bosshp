# RAZE BossHP Config

Config the BossHP for each map. This cannot be replaced with GFL BossHUD, since the config is completely different. If you know which plugin work with this config, feel free to use it.

#### THE STRIPPER IS NO LONGER NEED. REPLACING WITH HAMMERID INSTEAD.
the stripper of maps is for adding targetname of trigger_multiple in order to assign "trigger" for BossHP. We don't mess up your map, so don't worry.
