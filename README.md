# BossHP Config

Config the BossHP for each map. This cannot be replaced with GFL BossHUD, since the config is completely different. 
The plugin can be found in this link: https://gogs.botox.bz/CSSZombieEscape/sm-plugins/src/master/BossHP/scripting

### THE STRIPPER IS NO LONGER NEED. REPLACING WITH HAMMERID INSTEAD.

the stripper of maps is for adding targetname of trigger_multiple in order to assign "trigger" for BossHP. We don't mess up your map, so don't worry.
