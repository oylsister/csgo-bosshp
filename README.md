# BossHP Config

Config the BossHP for each map. This cannot be replace with GFL bosshud, since the config is completely different. If you know which plugin work with this config, feel free to use it.

"\_ra1" version is just adding a targetname of trigger_multiple in order to assign "trigger" for BossHP. We don't mess up your map, so don't worry.
